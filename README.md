GoDot Zip File for the resources used to create this game

# Why The Oracle Red Bull Team chose GoDot
It’s my engine of choice for 2D game development and it works well with 3D too. The release of Godot 3.0 brought a major update to the 3D features, bringing it up to speed with other modern game engines while keeping the free price tag.

Godot also offers a dedicated 2D engine that works in pixel coordinates and makes 2D development a breeze.

With a variety of languages available including C++, C#, and GDScript(a python variant), Godot is easy to program and easy to learn.

The best part of the Godot engine is the scene and node system. It makes organizing your games easy which speeds up development and improves the scalability of your projects.

With powerful animation tools and a built-in scripting editor, making games with Godot is a joy. Definitely worth a try, especially if you’re into 2D projects.
